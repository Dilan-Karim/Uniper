# Introduction
This project has been manufactured withing the requirements of the Uniper coding homerwork assignment to assess the coding ability of me. It entails three distinct tasks which focus on OOP, datastructures and search algorithms. The implementations will then be subject to separate predetermined unit tests. 
# Getting Started
## 0. Requirements
For this repository the main requirements to fulfilled manually is the installation of the conda package manager. Please install one of the versions provided here: [Conda Installation Guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
## 1. Getting Started with Uniper Repository Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Uniper repository.
Run the following command to clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Dilan-Karim/Uniper.git

Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

## 2. Create a New Conda Environment

Change into the cloned repository directory:

    cd Uniper

 Create a new Conda environment named “Uniper” using the provided environment.yml file:

    conda env create -f environment.yml

This will install all the necessary dependencies specified in the environment.yml file.

## 3. Activate the Conda Environment

Activate the “Uniper” environment:

    conda activate Uniper

You should see your prompt change to indicate that you are now in the “Uniper” environment.


# Build and Test

## Run the main.py file
To check the repositories fulfillment of the exercises you can run the "main.py" file. It will run all the provided unit tests.

Run the following command in your terminal:

    python3 main.py

It should return something like:

    ...........................................................
